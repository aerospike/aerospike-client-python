      # Originally we were going to have 3 workflows to build a single wheel, all wheels for a platform, and all artifacts for
      # the Python client. But for the workflow that builds all wheels for a platform, it would have to reuse and forward
      # most of the same inputs from the workflow that builds a single wheel, so we would have to maintain the same inputs in two places.
      # Combining the first two workflows into one (i.e this workflow) helps maintainability.

      # Ideally, we want to hardcode the runner OS version to make sure the wheels are always built in the same environment
      # for each platform.
      # But it is not possible in Github Actions to create a "map" of values
      # so we cannot map the platform tag to the runner OS.
      #
      # Solutions we considered:
      #
      # 1. We could create a workflow job that maps the platform tag to the runner OS,
      # but this would waste Github Actions resources if there were a calling workflow that runs this job many times
      # to build multiple wheels.
      # 2. We could create a list of string-encoded JSON lists that can be converted later into a real JSON list.
      # Each string encoded list is a list that contains the platform tag first, and then the runner OS second.
      # Each encoded list is a "choice" that can be selected from a workflow_dispatch input
      # but we decided against this because workflow_call doesn't support "choice" inputs, so we would have to update
      # the runner OS everywhere that this workflow is called by another workflow anyways.
      #
      # For now, just use two separate inputs for the platform tag and runner OS to keep things simple for both
      # workflow_dispatch and workflow_call
