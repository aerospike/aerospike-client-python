Introduction

The Aerospike Python client enables you to build an application in Python with an
Aerospike cluster as its database. The client manages the connections to the
cluster and handles the transactions performed against it.

The Python client is a CPython module built on the Aerospike C client.

.. rubric:: Data Model

At the top is the **namespace**, a container that has one set of policy rules
for all its data, and is similar to the *database* concept in an RDBMS, only
distributed across the cluster. A namespace is subdivided into **sets**,
similar to *tables*.

Pairs of key-value data called **bins** make up **records**, similar to
*columns* of a *row* in a standard RDBMS. Aerospike is schema-less, meaning
that you do not need to define your bins in advance.

Records are uniquely identified by their key, and record metadata is contained
in an in-memory primary index.

The :class:`aerospike` module contains these classes:

=================================    ===========
Class                                Description
=================================    ===========
:ref:`client`                        Aerospike client API
:ref:`aerospike.Scan`                Contains scan operations of entire sets.
:ref:`aerospike.Query`               Handles queries over secondary indexes.
:ref:`aerospike.geojson`             Handles GeoJSON type data.
:ref:`aerospike.KeyOrderedDict`      Key ordered dictionary
=================================    ===========

In addition, the :ref:`Data_Mapping` page explains how **Python** types map to **Aerospike Server** types.
