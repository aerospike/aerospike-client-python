# Version 7.2.0
date: 10/14/2022

## Bug Fixes

   - [CLIENT-1854] - Python client crashes while doing IO during server upgrade/downgrade

## Deprecationsâ€‹

    - client().connect() has been deprecated and it is a no-op. Client call itself establishes the connection object.
    - client().close() has been deprecated and it is a no-op. Client destroy unwinds the conection.
   - If user authentication method is used, then make sure to add user/password information into config dictionary for client call to succeed

ex) config = {
        'hosts': hosts,
        'policies': {'auth_mode': aerospike.AUTH_INTERNAL},
    }
    client = aerospike.client(config)
    client.connect(user, password)

    the above is changed to:

config = {
        'hosts': hosts,
        'policies': {'auth_mode': aerospike.AUTH_INTERNAL},
        'user': user,
        'password': password
    }
    client = aerospike.client(config)
    #following is no-op
    client.connect(user, password)
